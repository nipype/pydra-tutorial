# Tasks with States

Task might be run for a single set of input values or we can generate multiple sets, that will be called "states". If we want to run our `Task` multiple times we have to provide an input that is an iterable and specify the way we want to map values of the inputs to the specific states. In order to do it, we set so-called `splitter`.

Let's start from a simple `FunctionTask` that takes a list as an input:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
jupyter:
  outputs_hidden: false
pycharm:
  name: '#%%

    '
---
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pydra


@pydra.mark.task
def add_two(x):
    return x + 2


task1 = add_two(x=[1, 2, 3])
```

Before we set any splitter, the task's `state` should be `None`

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.state is None
```

Now, we can set the `splitter` using the `split` method. Since our task has only one input, there is only one option to create a set of inputs, i.e. `split(splitter='x', x=[1, 2, 3])`; make sure you define the value of `x` in the splitter as you did in `task`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.split('x', x=[1, 2, 3])
```

Now, we can check that our task has a `state`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.state
```

And we can print information about the state:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(task1.state)
```

within the `state` information about the splitter has been stored:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.state.splitter
```

Note, that *pydra* adds name of the function to the name of the input.

Now, we can run the task and check results:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1()
task1.result()
```

We can also return results together with values of the input, we just have to set an additional argument `return_inputs` to `True` (or `val`)

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.result(return_inputs=True)
```

If we want to return indices instead of values, we can set `return_inputs` to `ind`

```{code-cell} ipython3
task1.result(return_inputs='ind')
```

For tasks with a state *pydra* prepare all sets of inputs and run the task for each of the set. We could simply represent this by the following figure:

+++

## Multiple inputs and state splitting

We can also use `State` for functions with multiple inputs:

```{code-cell} ipython3
@pydra.mark.task
def add_var(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Now we have more options to define `splitter`, it depends on the type of inputs and on our application. For example, we could have `a` that is a list, `b` that is a single value, and split over `a` values:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task2 = add_var(a=[1, 2, 3], b=10).split('a', a=[1, 2, 3])
task2()
task2.result()
```

Now we have three results for each element from the `a` list and the value of `b` is always the same.

+++

![nd_spl_2.png](../figures/nd_spl_2.png)

+++

But we can have lists for both inputs, and use both inputs in the splitter. Let's assume that `a` and `b` are two elements lists.

```{code-cell} ipython3
task3 = add_var(a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
```

Now, we have two options to map the input values, we might want to run the task for two sets of values: (`a`=1, `b`=10) and (`a`=2, `b`=100), or we might want to run the task for four sets: (`a`=1, `b`=10), (`a`=1, `b`=100), (`a`=2, `b`=10) and (`a`=2, `b`=100).

**The first situation will be represented by the so-called "scalar" splitter, the later by the so-called "outer" splitter.**

+++

### Scalar splitter

Let's start from the scalar splitter, that uses parentheses in the syntax:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task3.split(('a', 'b'), a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task3()
task3.result()
```

As we expected, we have two outputs: `1+10=11` and `2+100=102`.

We can represent the execution by the graph:

+++

![nd_spl_4.png](../figures/nd_spl_4.png)

+++

### Outer splitter

For the outer splitter we will use brackets:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task4 = add_var(a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task4.split(['a', 'b'], a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task4()
task4.result()
```

Now, we have results for all of the combinations of values from `a` and `b`.

+++

![nd_spl_3.png](../figures/nd_spl_3.png)

+++

Note, that once you set the splitter, you will get error when you try to set the splitter again. However, you can always set `overwrite` to `True` if you really intend to change the splitter.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [raises-exception]

task4.split(('a', 'b'), a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
```

For more inputs we can create more complex splitter, and use scalar and outer splitters together. **Note, that the scalar splitter can only work for lists that have the same length, but the outer splitter doesn't have this limitation.**

Let's run one more example that takes four inputs, `x` and `y` components of two vectors, and calculates all possible sums of vectors. `x` components should be kept together with corresponding `y` components (i.e. scalar splitters: `("x1", "y1")` and `("x2", "y2")`), but we should use outer splitter for two vectors to get all combinations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@pydra.mark.task
def add_vector(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)


task5 = add_vector(
    name='add_vect',
    output_names=['x', 'y'],
    x1=[10, 20],
    y1=[1, 2],
    x2=[10, 20, 30],
    y2=[10, 20, 30],
)
task5.split(splitter=[('x1', 'y1'), ('x2', 'y2')],
            x1=[10, 20], y1=[1, 2], x2=[10, 20, 30], y2=[10, 20, 30])
task5()
task5.result()
```

We should get six outputs: two elements for vector1 times three elements for vector2.

+++

## Combining the output

When we use `splitter`, we can also define `combiner`, if we want to combine together the results.

If we take the `task4` as an example and combine all results for each element of the input `b`, we can modify the task as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task5 = add_var(a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task5.split(['a', 'b'], a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
# adding combiner
task5.combine('b')
task5()
task5.result()
```

Now our result contains two elements, each one is a list. The first one contains results for `a=1` and both values of `b`, and the second contains results for `a=2` and both values of `b`. Let's print the result again using `return_inputs`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
all_results = task5.result(return_inputs=True)
print(f'first list, a=1: {all_results[0]}')
print(f'\n second list, a=2: {all_results[1]}')
```

![nd_spl_3_comb1.png](../figures/nd_spl_3_comb1.png)

+++

But we could also group all elements from the input `a` and have a different combined output:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task6 = add_var(a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task6.split(['a', 'b'], a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
# changing the combiner
task6.combine('a')
task6()
task6.result()
```

We still have two elements in our results, but this time the first element contains results for `b=10` and both values of `a`, and the second contains results for `b=100` and both values of `a`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
all_results = task6.result(return_inputs=True)
print(f'first list, b=10: {all_results[0]}')
print(f'\n second list, b=100: {all_results[1]}')
```

![nd_spl_3_comb2.png](../figures/nd_spl_3_comb2.png)

+++

We can also combine all elements by providing a list of all inputs to the `combiner`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task7 = add_var(a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
task7.split(['a', 'b'], a=[1, 2], b=[10, 100])
# combining all inputs
task7.combine(['a', 'b'])
task7()
task7.result()
```

This time the output contains one element that is a list of all outputs:

+++

![nd_spl_3_comb3.png](../figures/nd_spl_3_comb3.png)

+++

## Lists as an input

Note that list can be used as an input even without using any splitter, there are functions that take a list as a single input value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
@pydra.mark.task
def moment(lst, n):
    return sum([i**n for i in lst]) / len(lst)


task8 = moment(n=3, lst=[2, 3, 4])

task8()
task8.result()
```

## Exercise 1

Let's say we want to calculate squares and cubes of integers from 2 to 5, and combine separately all squares and all cubes:

+++

First we will define a function that returns powers:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

@pydra.mark.task
def power(x, n):
    return x**n
```

Now we can create a task that takes two lists as its input, outer splitter for `x` and `n`, and combine all `x`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

task_ex1 = power(x=[2, 3, 4, 5], n=[2, 3]).split(['x', 'n'], x=[2, 3, 4, 5], n=[2, 3]).combine('x')
task_ex1()
task_ex1.result()
```

The result should contain two list, the first one is for squares, the second for cubes.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

squares_list = [el.output.out for el in task_ex1.result()[0]]
cubes_list = [el.output.out for el in task_ex1.result()[1]]
print(f'squares: {squares_list}')
print(f'cubes: {cubes_list}')
```

## Parallel execution

We run task multiple times for multiple sets of input, but we didn't talk about the execution time. Let's create a function that sleeps for a second and run for four values:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import time


@pydra.mark.task
def add_two_sleep(x):
    time.sleep(1)
    return x + 2


task9 = add_two_sleep(x=[1, 2, 3, 4]).split('x', x=[1, 2, 3, 4])
t0 = time.time()
task9()
print(f'total time: {time.time() - t0}')
task9.result()
```

The total time will depend on the machine you are using, but it could be below `1.1s`, so clearly the tasks are running in parallel!

If we run `Task` that has a `State`, pydra will automatically create a `Submitter` with a default `Worker` that is `cf`, i.e. `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.

We could also create a `Submitter` first, and than use it to run the task:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task10 = add_two_sleep(x=[1, 2, 3, 4]).split('x', x=[1, 2, 3, 4])

t0 = time.time()
with pydra.Submitter(plugin='cf') as sub:
    task10(submitter=sub)
print(f'total time: {time.time() - t0}')
print(f'results: {task10.result()}')
```

or we can provide the name of the plugin:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task11 = add_two_sleep(x=[1, 2, 3, 4]).split('x', x=[1, 2, 3, 4])

t0 = time.time()
task11(plugin='cf')
print(f'total time: {time.time() - t0}')
print(f'results: {task11.result()}')
```

The last option for running the task is to create a `Submitter` first and run the submitter (`Submitter` is also a callable object) with the task as  a `runnable`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
task12 = add_two_sleep(x=[1, 2, 3, 4]).split('x', x=[1, 2, 3, 4])

t0 = time.time()
with pydra.Submitter(plugin='cf') as sub:
    sub(runnable=task12)
print(f'total time: {time.time() - t0}')
print(f'results: {task12.result()}')
```

All of the execution time should be similar, since all tasks are run by *pydra* in the same way, i.e. *pydra* creates a submitter with `ConcurrentFutures` worker, if a number of processors is not provided, `ConcurrentFutures` takes all available processors as `max_workers`. However, if we want to set a specific number of processors, we can set it using `n_procs` when creating a `Submitter`. Let's see how the execution time changes when we use `n_procs=2`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
task13 = add_two_sleep(x=[1, 2, 3, 4]).split('x', x=[1, 2, 3, 4])

t0 = time.time()
with pydra.Submitter(plugin='cf', n_procs=2) as sub:
    sub(runnable=task13)
print(f'total time: {time.time() - t0}')
print(f'results: {task13.result()}')
```

Now, the total time could be significantly different. For example, if your machine has at least 4 processors, the previous `tasks9` - `task12` took around 1s to run, but the task13 took around 2s.
If you have 2 processors or less, you should not see any difference in the execution time.
